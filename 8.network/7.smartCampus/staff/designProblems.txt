1) to much intertwined connections between communication and other devices

2) agent build his own messages instead only payload

3) smartHouse part works with pthread and not nthread

4) agent loader to dependent on communicating with database instead of seperated parts

5) user interact directly with hub insted of seperate api

6) query as struct is problematic if query changes alot of parts need to change(search table, registration connector, registration handler, query itsef)

7) messgages between smart building and though the same building are passing through the same path. agents can get messages from section they didnt ask for and section can get msges from other sections (also can create loop)

8) vectorSearchTable supports duplicates(shouldn't need a mechanism to prevent this)
