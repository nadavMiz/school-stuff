1) to much intertwined connections between communication and other devices

2) agent build his own messages instead only payload

4) agent loader to dependent on communicating with database instead of seperated parts

5) user interact directly with hub insted of seperate api

6) query as struct is problematic if query changes alot of parts need to change(search table, registration connector, registration handler, query itsef)

7) diffrent subscription api between subscribing to main hub and subscribing to other hubs through communication
